# PyBolt
PyBolt is a Python framework for the computation of dark matter relic density and energy distribution. The framework allows to construct models with the parameters and processes provided by the user (or selected from the library of classes) and to solve number density Boltzmann equation or the Boltzmann equation for the phase-space density for the given models.

## Current version

The current version includes:
1) 2-body decay process that produce one dark matter particle (which is the case of some dark radiation models like axions from lepton flavor-violating decays);
2) Simplified treatment of the lepton annihilation into an axion and photon (assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for leptons)
3) Simplified treatment of the Primakoff scattering on leptons (assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for leptons)

## Generating distribution files

Axion distribution files over a grid of decay constants are produced by a resumable,
PBS-array-parallel pipeline (`submit_axion.sh` -> `fBE_LFC.py` -> `merge_distributions.py`).

See [docs/WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md) for how to run it.
